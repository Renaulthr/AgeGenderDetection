# Age and Gender Detection Model

## Overview

This project uses a machine learning model built with TensorFlow to detect the age and gender of a person from their facial image. The model is integrated with a Tkinter GUI, allowing users to upload images and view the predicted age and gender.

## Features

- Age and gender detection from facial images
- Tkinter GUI for user-friendly interaction
- TensorFlow-based machine learning model
- Support for various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.4+
- Keras 2.4+
- Tkinter
- OpenCV 4.5+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/Renaulthr/AgeGenderDetection.git]
2. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application: python GUI.py

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Upload a facial image using the "Upload Image" button
3. Click the "Detect" button to run the age and gender detection model
4. View the predicted age and gender in the GUI

## Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using a dataset of facial images with age and gender labels. The training process involves data preprocessing, model compilation, and training.
